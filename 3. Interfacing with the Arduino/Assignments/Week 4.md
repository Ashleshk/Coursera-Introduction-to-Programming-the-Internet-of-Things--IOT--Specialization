### Write about the design of a system that you might build for your home which uses an Arduino with a wifi shield. The system must use the wifi connection for a useful purpose in the system. The Arduino should be wired to sensors and/or actuators which help it to perform some useful task in your home. 

Smart Fridge is a good example wich uses an Arduino with a wifi shield. 
For example, a smart fridge detects from its inside that there is no butter, 
so it orders butter for you through different products companies. 
The main sensor that will be wired to the Arduino is a camera sensor.
The wifi connection will be needed to provide the products that are 
sold online and that will be sent directly to home.
It is also needed to do the online payment.
